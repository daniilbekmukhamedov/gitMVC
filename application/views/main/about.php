                                <h3>
                                    Hello, my name is Daniil, I'm from Kazakhstan, and I'm a developer. I want to introduce you to my project. This is a classical MVC.
                                </h3>
                                <span>
                                    First I will show you the feedback page, you can fill the form <a href="/contact" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">here</a>, and site send you the messsage on email, wich you indicated in the form, there is no logic, but I did this, to you make sure, that form works. As you can see, user can not to send not valid email, name and message, the same with sending empty input fields.
                                </span>
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                <span>
                                    Further I suggest you to use the admin-panel. <a href="/admin/login" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">The log in page here</a>. Login: admin, password: admin. After you've got authorized, you can see more buttons in the header and in the right side. Thus you can <a href="/admin/add" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">add</a>, edit and delete news. You also cannot post not valid data. After you added news, you can see them <a href="/" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">here</a>.
                                </span>
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                <span>
                                    Thank you for attention! I hope you have got interested my work, an see you in the next projects.
                                    <br/>
